# Methane Hydrate's Thermal Dissociation Study Tools

This repository contains the tools used in our published paper to study the kinetics of methane hydrateâ€™s thermal dissociation. These tools include Python scripts and TCL scripts, organized in the following directories:

- `hydrate_diss_mass`: This folder contains the Python scripts used to calculate the mass of the remaining hydrates while dissociating. The calculation is performed using the template-matching algorithm.

- `tcl_scripts`: This folder contains the TCL scripts that automate the loading of LAMMPS trajectory files. Additionally, it automates the rendering of sliced chunks of the box, which are used as input to the Python scripts.

These tools have been carefully developed and used in our research, and we believe that they can be beneficial for similar studies in the field.
